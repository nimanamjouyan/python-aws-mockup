## Notes

- You already need to have set up a user with appropriate programatic access to be able to programatically create ec2 instances and have your access key and secret key credentials.

- Note that currently you can add multiple private keys. For each key one enters, whatever number of instances specified in ```num_instances``` field, will be created. For example, if you add two keys and ```num_instances``` is 2, then for each key, two instances will be created (total of 4 instances). Each pair corresponding to one of the two keys.
